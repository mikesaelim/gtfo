GTFO: Go The F*** Outside!


----

## Development notes for my future self

Workflow:
* Make some changes
* `npm start` to run the app locally and playtest the changes
* `npm run lint` to run ESLint
* `npm test` to run Jest/Testing Library tests
* `npm run build` to build the assets and put them in the `/docs` folder
* Commit and push changes

This repo is set up to publish the `/docs` folder to GitHub Pages, following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
